26008 - Inventory Optimization
Inefficient Inventory Planning and Stock Imbalance Across Supply Chains Retailers, warehouses, manufacturers, and small-to-medium enterprises frequently face challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Overstocking leads to increased holding costs, spoilage, and capital lock-in, while understocking results in lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and supply disruptions.
Retailers, warehouses, manufacturers, and small-to-medium enterprises frequently face challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Overstocking leads to increased holding costs, spoilage, and capital lock-in, while understocking results in lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and supply disruptions.

In many cases, inventory decisions are based on static forecasting models, manual estimation, or historical averages that fail to adapt to:

* Seasonal demand variability

* Sudden demand spikes or supply disruptions

* Regional consumption patterns

* Perishable inventory constraints

* Multi-warehouse distribution complexities

Additionally, fragmented data systems and lack of predictive visibility prevent organizations from responding dynamically to changing market conditions.

Challenge Statement Design a scalable and intelligent inventory optimization framework that dynamically balances supply and demand, minimizes stockouts and overstocking, and improves overall supply chain efficiency under real-world uncertainty.
